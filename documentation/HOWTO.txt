How to write a new test:


First we need to include the the test base class from which all tests are derived.

from core.tests.testBase import testBase

Second we declare our test class and inhiret from testBase

for exmaple:
class LmLenientModeTest(testBase):

Third we must inlcude the meta data statment in order for the test engine to recognize that this is a test meant for execution. 
TEST = True 

Forth and last we need to implement the run function 

an exmaple test would look like this: 

TEST = True

from core.tests.testBase import testBase

class Test(testBase):
    def run(self):
        self.log.info('this is a test test', 'g')
 
Import Notes:
1) all tests must be under the directory ~/svt/tests/  other wise they will not be recognized by the test engine.
2) the test name and the file name must be the same becuase the instation of the test class is based on the test file name. 
3) the meta statment "TEST = Ture" should be included in the file from which you wish to instantioat the test class if the test class inherts from a higher calss the higher class may not have this statement.

How to run debug mode:

Assuming sv driver is installed and loaded

First got to the desired device directory.
for example:
$ cd ~/svt/deviced/cvl

Second run the start script with the -a flag. this will query the driver and create instanced of the cvl object for each PF
 $ ./start.py -a 


use the cli to run debug commands. the cli supports tab completion. 


if you would like to run debug mode for a device found on a different machine in the lab

run: 
$ ./start.py -a -r ladhxxx


this will create instanced for the remote PFs
